The statistics for a window of an engineering observation is called running window quantity. Running intra-covariance is a special case of running inter-covariance, when two variables are the same. The inter-covariance minus the geometric average of respected intra-covariances is called the pure inter-covariance. It gives you cleaner association analysis compared with the running Pearson analysis. The normalization of covariance to standard deviation is called Pearson correlation coefficient. The covariance for the region above or below the average is called semi-covariance (upper or down). Here we present a pure running semi-covariance, an accurate ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) way of measuring the inter-non-linear correlation between variables exclude the inter-non-linear components. Our framework is applied to successfully analyze the association between alternative factors and the toll response. The result of our analyses of the 12 years period after the 2007 Mortgage crisis on the war equipment companies stock versus the gold suggest that stocks from different regions have slightly different impact on the gold value that reflects the overall economy prosperities.  
The Input tab is to line up the date, InterCov tab is the output, the rest tags are intermediate semi-covariance calculations.
